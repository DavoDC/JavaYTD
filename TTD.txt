Put Jytd in its own folder in GDrive and update copy script accordingly

Do date comparison on youtube-dl, update if no match

Problem: Sometimes hangs and no way to tell if actually downloading
Solution: Push output to 'last run logâ€™ like netbeans, check on download there, let user know 

Add fast download button - Skip parse, Default download

Look for youtube ID in new file when moving file to dwl, 
more stringent check, will help when doing concurrent downloads

Disable download until current dwl finished
Disable everyhing when downloading, only enable after

Add --help to show how CLI command works (only one atm)
Add message to say, batch download done, exiting

Change verbose to v 


Show title after parsing?


Make it fullscreen
